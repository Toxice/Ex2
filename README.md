# Welocme to My Solution for Ex2 - a SpreadSheet
📋 What Does This Do?
Imagine Excel had a baby with Java, and that baby decided to rebel against its spreadsheet parents. This project is a Java-based spreadsheet implementation where cells:

Hold numbers, text, or the wildest formulas you can conjure.
Depend on each other in a tangled web of mathematical drama.

🚀 Features
Numbers: Yep, the boring stuff works.
Text: Just type "hello," and it’ll actually stay there.
Formulas: Write =A1+B2, and watch the magic.
Errors: Enjoy ERR_CYCLE! and ERR_FORM! as the universe tells you to try harder.
GUI: A functional interface that looks better than my handwriting.


🧪 Testing
I've thrown everything at it: invalid inputs, complex formulas, and my frustration too. If it breaks, let's hope it won't break.
